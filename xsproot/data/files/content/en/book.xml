        A <b>book</b> is a medium for recording information in the form of writing or images,
        typically composed of many pages (made of papyrus, parchment, vellum, or paper) bound
        together and protected by a cover.[1] The technical term for this physical arrangement
        is codex (plural, codices). In the history of hand-held physical supports for extended
        written compositions or records, the codex replaces its predecessor, the scroll. A
        single sheet in a codex is a leaf and each side of a leaf is a page.
