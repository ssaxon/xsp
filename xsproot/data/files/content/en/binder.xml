        <b>Ring binders (loose leaf binders, looseleaf binders</b>, or sometimes called <b>files</b> in Britain)
        are large folders that contain file folders or hole punched papers. These binders come in various sizes
        and can accommodate an array of paper sizes. These are held in the binder by circular or D-shaped
        retainers, onto which the contents are threaded. The rings themselves come in a variety of sizes,
        including 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 inches (13, 25, 38, and 51 mm), though other sizes are also available. The
        rings are usually spring-loaded, but can also be secured by lever arch[1] mechanisms or other securing
        systems. The binders themselves are typically made from plastic with metal rings. Early designs were
        patented during the early 1890s to the early 1900s.
